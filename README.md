Project Description
This is a web-based application that helps engineering students generate personalized internship application letters using AI.

Built with Python, Gradio, FPDF, and Google's Gemini API (Generative AI).

Users input key details such as:

Full name

Degree and specialization

Skills

Relevant experience

Target company and internship role

Preferred tone (Formal, Confident, Friendly)

The application uses prompt engineering to generate a structured, contextually relevant cover letter in real time.

The AI-generated letter is professional in tone and tailored to fit technical roles in various engineering disciplines.

The final output is displayed within the app and can be downloaded directly as a PDF document.

The UI is built using Gradio for simplicity and usability, with a two-column layout for input and output.

A session-based application history is also maintained to help users keep track of previous generations.

This tool is ideal for:

Final-year engineering students

Internship/job seekers

Campus placement support cells

The project demonstrates practical use of prompt engineering, LLM integration, and PDF generation in a real-world student workflow.
